# üîµ Diabetes Risk Analysis
This is a predictive healthcare analytics project based on the [Pima Indians dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/review/data) on Kaggle. This project aims to help patients and healthcare providers better understand an individual‚Äôs risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes by analyzing various health indicators and finding their predictive strengths. Excel and Tableau are the main two tools that will be used in this analysis.

## üìä About the Data

The data was found on Kaggle but was originally from the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases. All patients in the dataset were female, over 21 years of age, and of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset contained several medical predictor variables and one outcome variable which was whether the patient was diabetic or not. Dataset attributes included:

- Pregnancies: To express the number of pregnancies
- Glucose: To express the glucose level in blood
- BloodPressure: To express the blood pressure measurement
- SkinThickness: To express the thickness of the skin
- Insulin: To express the insulin level in blood
- BMI: To express the body mass index
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: To express the diabetes percentage
- Age: To express the age
- Outcome: To express the final result 1 is YES o is NO

## üßê Methods/Analysis
1. Pulled data from Pima Indians dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/review/data).
2. Cleaned the dataset on Excel. Started off by taking columns I did not need such as "DiabetesPedigree". Analyzed 7 columns such as BMI, Blood Pressure, Age, Insulin, Glucose, Skin Thickness, and # of Pregnancies. Then, got rid of impossible "zeros" that were in various columns (ex: BloodPressure cannot be "0" otherwise the patient would be dead).
3. To find which health indicators were better predictors on diabetic outcome, I first performed summary statistics on the 7 attributes I was analyzing. I used pivot tables to show the mean, min, and max, for both the diabetic and non-diabetic group and compared the difference.
4. To better understand the differences in summary statistics, I created a dashboard containing box-whisker plots for each of the 7 attributes. View the dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jaylen.roope/viz/ComparingHealthIndicatorsinDiabeticvsNon-DiabeticIndividuals/DemographicsandBodyMeasures).
5. Used the "CORREL" function to find the correlation of all 7 attributes with diabetic outcome.
6. Implemented a multivariate diabetes risk index by normalizing each individual's health attribute value as well as the correlation scores of the corresponding attribute. See how I calculated the risk score [here](https://github.com/jaylenroope-afk/DiabetesRiskPredictor/blob/main/Risk%20Calculation/DiabetesRiskCalculation.pdf)
7. Used conditional formatting to categorize the risk scores as "high", "moderate", or "low" risk
8. Created another [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jaylen.roope/viz/DiabetesRiskLevelAnalysis/Dashboard1) that shows a scatterplot between the two variables with the highest correlations. The datapoints are color-coded based on risk level and viewers can move their mouse to a specific data point to see their specific health indicator values to see what is considered risky for diabetes.

## ‚úÖ Results
- The best predictor for diabetic outcome was **glucose level** which had a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.309 while the worst predictor was **blood pressure** with a correlation coefficient of 0.024
- With glucose levels and skin thickness (R = 0.249) being the strongest predictors we can reduce diabetes risk by making lifestyle choices that reduce these numbers. Glucose levels and skin thickness can be reduced by eating a healthy diet and minimizing sugar intake, while also exercising frequently.  
- Healthcare providers can utilize this data analysis by measuring these variables and use the risk score calculation to identify at-risk patients and monitor their blood-sugar levels and provide counseling on diet and exericse.
- Limitations include ignoring genetics and only using females over the age of 21 and of Pima Indian descent.
